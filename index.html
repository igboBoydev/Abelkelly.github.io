                  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                  the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</h6>

                  ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

          <h6>
            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
            professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
            did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In <br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
            experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
            100% recommend! ‚Äù
